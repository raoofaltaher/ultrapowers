**Injection** (subagent_type: `general`)
Trace untrusted input from entry point to dangerous sink. What counts as a "dangerous sink" depends on the application:
- Web apps: SQL queries, HTML output, shell commands, template engines, file paths, HTTP redirects, deserialization
- Libraries: any function that processes caller-supplied data without validation — buffer operations, parsers, format strings
- CLI tools: shell command construction, file path handling, environment variable interpolation
- Services: query construction, message serialization, log injection, LDAP/XPATH queries
- Client-side (browser/JS): DOM XSS, prototype pollution, `postMessage`/origin trust, and other browser-side classes — covered by the [CLIENT-SIDE.md](CLIENT-SIDE.md) companion blocks when selected

Do not stop at the obvious direct paths. Look for indirect injection: data stored safely, then retrieved and used in a dangerous context by different code. Look for injection through field names, keys, headers, and metadata — not just values. Look for injection into secondary systems (logs, caches, search indexes, analytics).
**Resource and file handling** (subagent_type: `general`)
- Path traversal (reading/writing outside intended directories) — including through symlinks, encoded sequences, and null bytes
- SSRF (making the application fetch attacker-controlled URLs) — including through redirects, DNS rebinding, and URL parser differentials
- Unsafe deserialization, archive extraction (zip slip), temp file handling
- Memory safety (if applicable): buffer overflows, use-after-free, integer overflow
- Race conditions on file operations (TOCTOU between check and use)
**Cryptography and secrets** (subagent_type: `general`)
- Weak randomness for security-critical values (tokens, keys, nonces)
- Hardcoded secrets, secrets in logs, error messages, URLs, or client-visible responses
- Broken key derivation, missing HMAC verification, nonce reuse
- Timing side-channels on secret comparison
- Misuse of crypto primitives (ECB mode, unauthenticated encryption, static IVs, etc.)
- What happens when crypto operations fail? Does the error path fall back to no-crypto?
## Core discipline (include in every agent prompt for this domain)

```
- Do not infer a live exposure from a manifest alone. Establish which environment consumes it, what defaults or overlays modify it, and whether the source path is active.
- Map each workload's identity to specific operations and resources. Broad policy is a finding only when lower-trust input can reach an unauthorized action.
- Ingress, proxies, service mesh, metadata services, and admission policy are real boundaries, but only count a control when its configuration and attachment are visible.
- Secret references are not secret disclosure. Require a lower-trust reader, output, artifact, log path, or unsafe fallback.
- Use `confirmed` for active in-repo configurations and local rendering/policy validation. Use `needs_validation` for account policy, network attachment, runtime admission, hosted metadata, or drift that needs owner observation.
```
## Container and orchestration attack classes (subagent_type: `general`)

**Host or control-plane capability exposure**
A lower-trust workload can select privileged mode, capabilities, host namespaces, host paths, device mounts, container runtime sockets, or service-account tokens that cross into node/control-plane authority. Bare absence of seccomp or read-only filesystem is hardening unless a reachable operation crosses that boundary.
**Secret exposure across workload boundaries**
Secrets enter logs, crash reports, process arguments, shared environment, broad volumes, build outputs, service discovery, or read APIs accessible to another workload or tenant. Check secret type and authority; a public endpoint or key ID is not a credential.
## Universal moves (apply across the above)

- Render every maintained environment and make a matrix of external port, workload identity, network peers, mounted secrets, and cloud resources. Differences require an owner or policy explanation.
- Follow a lower-trust request, object, label, or event into cloud policy. Show which workload credential performs the final operation and what condition should scope it.
- Diff normal deploy, migration, restore, node maintenance, failover, and local/emulator paths. Review behavior when mesh, admission, identity, secret, or policy service is unavailable.

## Validation rules (apply before reporting ANY finding here)

1. Establish the active source path and effective deployment object; otherwise use `needs_validation` and state which rendered manifest or owner-observed attachment is missing.
2. Name the lower-trust caller/workload, cloud or application identity, controllable selector, affected resource, and unauthorized operation or disclosure.
3. Verify provider and orchestrator defaults at the pinned version. Do not assume a public IP, reachable metadata service, permissive firewall, or absent admission attachment.
4. Local validation may render templates, evaluate policy, inspect container/user namespaces in an isolated fixture, or run an emulator with dummy identities. Do not probe live endpoints or alter shared cloud resources.
5. Return `confirmed` only with a complete active source trace and concrete boundary result. Return `needs_validation` with the exact deployed policy, identity attachment, overlay, network, or drift observation needed.
