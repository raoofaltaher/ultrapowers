**Access control** (subagent_type: `general`)
Verify that a caller cannot do something outside its authority. Go beyond checking whether permission checks exist — verify they check the *right* permission for the *right* resource via the *right* mechanism:
- Is there a path to the same state change that checks a different (weaker) permission?
- Can a field in the request body override what the permission system intended to restrict?
- Are there endpoints that gate on authentication but forget authorization?
- Does the same resource have multiple access paths with inconsistent checks?
- What about bulk/batch/export/import operations — do they enforce per-item permissions?

For complex access models, split into separate agents for auth bypass vs authorization logic.
**Resource and file handling** (subagent_type: `general`)
- Path traversal (reading/writing outside intended directories) — including through symlinks, encoded sequences, and null bytes
- SSRF (making the application fetch attacker-controlled URLs) — including through redirects, DNS rebinding, and URL parser differentials
- Unsafe deserialization, archive extraction (zip slip), temp file handling
- Memory safety (if applicable): buffer overflows, use-after-free, integer overflow
- Race conditions on file operations (TOCTOU between check and use)
**Cryptography and secrets** (subagent_type: `general`)
- Weak randomness for security-critical values (tokens, keys, nonces)
- Hardcoded secrets, secrets in logs, error messages, URLs, or client-visible responses
- Broken key derivation, missing HMAC verification, nonce reuse
- Timing side-channels on secret comparison
- Misuse of crypto primitives (ECB mode, unauthenticated encryption, static IVs, etc.)
- What happens when crypto operations fail? Does the error path fall back to no-crypto?
## Core discipline (include in every agent prompt for this domain)

```
- Prompt injection alone is not a finding. Require a code-level boundary failure: content reaches another principal's context, invokes authority the requester lacks, discloses data they cannot read, or drives a sink they cannot reach directly.
- Model output, memory, tool descriptions, and MCP responses are untrusted inputs. Point to the code that grants authority, trusts output, writes durable state, or feeds a sink.
- A guardrail prompt is not a security boundary. Count only deterministic checks, resource-scoped authorization, isolation, binding, and constrained credentials.
- State the attacker, affected principal, effective execution identity, resource, exact action, authority used, and observable impact. An intentional direct request to use the requester's existing authority is not a delegation defect merely because a model executes it.
- Authorization and action binding are separate controls. Attacker-controlled content that causes an action under an affected principal's valid authority is an action-binding failure when that principal did not intentionally request or approve the exact action.
- Classify every candidate as `confirmed` only after source evidence and bounded local validation establish the boundary and result. Use `needs_validation` when a required provider, deployment, model, renderer, or identity behavior is not observable locally.
```
**Tool-argument injection into a downstream sink**
Model-produced arguments reach SQL, shell, file, URL-fetch, or privileged APIs without handler-side validation. Treat the tool schema as input parsing, then follow each field from decoded call to sink. Structured output narrows shape; it does not establish authorization, safe paths, safe URLs, or query semantics.
**Excessive agency and confused-deputy authority**
The agent uses a service identity or broad credential, while the tool handler does not re-check the requesting principal's permission on the named resource. Verify both the effective identity and whether the caller could perform that exact operation through the normal product interface. A shared credential with enforced per-user query scope is not a defect.
## Universal moves (apply across the above)

- Draw four maps first: each execution identity, each capability, every writable context or memory source, and each output destination. Then connect the principal at the start to the authority at the end.
- Start at side-effecting tools and work backward through dispatcher, schema, confirmation, model context, retrieval, and ingestion. Start at durable memory reads and trace every writer.
- Compare direct, queued, retry, resume, batch, and delegated paths for the same action. The strongest gate must apply after arguments are final and before every side effect.

## Validation rules (apply before reporting ANY finding here)

1. Name the crossed boundary and observable result: attacker, affected principal or shared resource, execution identity, target, and unauthorized or unrequested action or disclosure.
2. For confused-deputy authority claims, prove the tool lacks requester-and-resource authorization and that the attacker cannot perform the same action normally. For action-binding claims, instead prove attacker-controlled content caused an action under the affected principal's authority that the principal did not intentionally request or approve. Valid generic authorization does not establish that intent.
3. For memory or retrieval claims, cite both the attacker-controlled write and the later cross-principal read or privileged decision. A shared record without a reachable consumer is not enough.
4. For action binding, establish the intentional request or normalized approved object, if any, and compare it with the object the handler uses. Confirm a locally observable unrequested action, mutation, duplicate, or authority change without extending the test into harmful execution. For schema disagreement, compare the normalized validated object with the handler's object.
5. For MCP identity claims, verify the authenticated connection, request correlation, tool namespace, and effective credential. Mark `needs_validation` if external server identity or deployment routing is required.
6. Return `confirmed` findings only with a complete source trace and meaningful result. Return `needs_validation` for a specific unresolved boundary fact and state the bounded local or owner-observed check needed to resolve it.
