## How it works

It starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. As soon as it sees that you're building something, it *doesn't* just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do. 

Once it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. 

After you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY. 

Next up, once you say "go", it launches a *subagent-driven-development* process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for your agent to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.

There's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your coding agent just has Ultrapowers.

## Commercial Services

If you're using Ultrapowers in enterprise and could benefit from commercial support, additional tooling, or managed spending, please don't hesitate to drop us a line at sales@primeradiant.com.

## Installation

Installation differs by harness. If you use more than one, install Ultrapowers separately for each one.

### Claude Code

Ultrapowers is available via the [official Claude plugin marketplace](https://claude.com/plugins/ultrapowers)

#### Official Marketplace

- Install the plugin from Anthropic's official marketplace:

  ```bash
  /plugin install ultrapowers@claude-plugins-official
  ```

#### Ultrapowers Marketplace

The Ultrapowers marketplace provides Ultrapowers and some other related plugins for Claude Code.

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  /plugin marketplace add raoofaltaher/ultrapowers-marketplace
  ```

- Install the plugin from this marketplace:

  ```bash
  /plugin install ultrapowers@ultrapowers-marketplace
  ```

### Antigravity

Install Ultrapowers as a plugin from this repository:

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/raoofaltaher/ultrapowers
```

Antigravity runs the plugin's session-start hook, so Ultrapowers is active from
the first message. Reinstall with the same command to update.

### Codex App

Ultrapowers is available via the [official Codex plugin marketplace](https://github.com/openai/plugins).

- In the Codex app, click on Plugins in the sidebar.
- You should see `Ultrapowers` in the Coding section.
- Click the `+` next to Ultrapowers and follow the prompts.

### Codex CLI

Ultrapowers is available via the [official Codex plugin marketplace](https://github.com/openai/plugins).

- Open the plugin search interface:

  ```bash
  /plugins
  ```

- Search for Ultrapowers:

  ```bash
  ultrapowers
  ```

- Select `Install Plugin`.

### Cursor

- In Cursor Agent chat, install from marketplace:

  ```text
  /add-plugin ultrapowers
  ```

- Or search for "ultrapowers" in the plugin marketplace.

### Devin CLI

- Install the plugin from this repository:

  ```bash
  devin plugins install raoofaltaher/ultrapowers
  ```

- Update to the latest version with:

  ```bash
  devin plugins update ultrapowers
  ```

### Factory Droid

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  droid plugin marketplace add https://github.com/raoofaltaher/ultrapowers
  ```

- Install the plugin:

  ```bash
  droid plugin install ultrapowers@ultrapowers
  ```

### Gemini CLI

- Install the extension:

  ```bash
  gemini extensions install https://github.com/raoofaltaher/ultrapowers
  ```

- Update later:

  ```bash
  gemini extensions update ultrapowers
  ```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  copilot plugin marketplace add raoofaltaher/ultrapowers-marketplace
  ```

- Install the plugin:

  ```bash
  copilot plugin install ultrapowers@ultrapowers-marketplace
  ```

### Grok Build CLI

Ultrapowers is available via the [official Grok plugin marketplace](https://github.com/xai-org/plugin-marketplace).

- Install the plugin from xAI's official marketplace:

  ```bash
  grok plugin install ultrapowers@xai-official --trust
  ```

- Or open the marketplace in the TUI, search for Ultrapowers, and install it:

  ```text
  /marketplace
  ```

### Kimi Code

Ultrapowers is available in Kimi Code's plugin marketplace.

- Open Kimi Code's plugin manager:

  ```text
  /plugins
  ```

- Go to `Marketplace` > `Ultrapowers` and install it.

- Or install directly from this repository:

  ```text
  /plugins install https://github.com/raoofaltaher/ultrapowers
  ```

- Detailed docs: [docs/README.kimi.md](docs/README.kimi.md)

### OpenCode

OpenCode uses its own plugin install; install Ultrapowers separately even if you
already use it in another harness.

- Tell OpenCode:

  ```
  Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raoofaltaher/ultrapowers/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md
  ```

- Detailed docs: [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md)

### Pi

Install Ultrapowers as a Pi package from this repository:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/raoofaltaher/ultrapowers
```

For local development, run Pi with this checkout loaded as a temporary package:

```bash
pi -e /path/to/ultrapowers
```

The Pi package loads the Ultrapowers skills and a small extension that injects the `using-ultrapowers` bootstrap at session startup and again after compaction. Pi has native skills, so no compatibility `Skill` tool is required. Subagent and task-list tools remain optional Pi companion packages.

### Qwen Code

Qwen Code installs plugins from Claude Code marketplaces directly.

- Install the plugin from this repository, and pick `ultrapowers` when prompted:

  ```bash
  qwen extensions install raoofaltaher/ultrapowers
  ```

- Update later:

  ```bash
  qwen extensions update ultrapowers
  ```

### Hermes Agent

Install Ultrapowers as a Hermes plugin from this repository:

```bash
hermes plugins install raoofaltaher/ultrapowers --enable
```

Restart any active Hermes sessions after installing. Note: Hermes has no
post-compaction hook, so a very long session that compacts over its first
turn loses the bootstrap — start a fresh session if skills stop triggering.

### Muse

Ultrapowers is available as a native Muse plugin — same repo, same skills, all harnesses. The `using-ultrapowers` bootstrap is injected via the native `SessionStart` hook alongside Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Pi, and the rest — no per-session opt-in.

- Install from a local checkout:

  ```bash
  muse plugins install ./
  muse plugins approve ultrapowers
  ```

  Or clone and install:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/raoofaltaher/ultrapowers.git
  muse plugins install ./ultrapowers
  muse plugins approve ultrapowers
  ```

- Update later:

  ```bash
  muse plugins update ultrapowers
  ```

Restart any active Muse sessions after installing so the `SessionStart` hook takes effect — skills are active immediately, hooks require approval on first install. To verify, start a fresh session and send `Let's make a react todo list` — a working install auto-triggers `brainstorming` before any code is written. Version is tracked in `.version-bump.json` so `scripts/bump-version.sh` keeps it in sync.

## The Basic Workflow

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections for validation. Saves design document.

2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.

3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps.

4. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Activates with plan. Either dispatches a fresh subagent per task with a review after each (most thorough), or implements every task inline in the current session with one fresh review of the whole branch at the end (cheapest).

5. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.

6. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.

7. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard), cleans up worktree.

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

## When Something Goes Wrong

Sometimes a session misbehaves: a skill fires when it shouldn't, stays silent when it should, or the agent ignores its plan, repeats work, or burns more tokens than you'd expect. Ask your coding agent to "figure out what went wrong with ultrapowers in this session" and it will invoke the **diagnosing-ultrapowers** skill. To examine an earlier session, name it: "figure out what went wrong with ultrapowers in session `<id>`".

The skill reads the session transcript, reports what happened with line-level evidence, and, if you want, packages a scrubbed bundle for a bug report.

## Contributing

The general contribution process for Ultrapowers is below. Keep in mind that we don't generally accept contributions of new skills and that any updates to skills must work across all of the coding agents we support.

1. Fork the repository
2. Switch to the 'dev' branch
3. Create a branch for your work
4. Follow the `writing-skills` skill for creating and testing new and modified skills
5. Submit a PR, being sure to fill in the pull request template.

Skill-behavior tests use the drill eval harness from [ultrapowers-evals](https://github.com/prime-radiant-inc/ultrapowers-evals/), cloned into `evals/` — see `evals/README.md` for setup. Plugin-infrastructure tests live at `tests/` and run via the relevant `run-*.sh` or `npm test`.

See `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` for the complete guide.

## Updating

Ultrapowers updates are somewhat coding-agent dependent, but are often automatic.

## Visual companion telemetry

Because skills and plugins don't provide any feedback to creators, we have no idea how many of you are using Ultrapowers. By default, the Prime Radiant logo on brainstorming's optional visual companion feature is loaded from our website. It includes the version of Ultrapowers in use. It does not include any details about your project, prompt, or coding agent. We don't see your clicks or anything about what you're building. This helps us have a rough idea of how many folks are using Ultrapowers and which version of Ultrapowers they're using. It's 100% optional. To disable this, set the environment variable `ULTRAPOWERS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` to any true value. Ultrapowers also honors Claude Code's `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` opt-outs.
